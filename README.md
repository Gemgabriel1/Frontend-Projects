### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned
I learnt how to link external style css, use the transform styling, create a rectangle and style the page entirely

### Continued development
I intend to focus on how to get a less bulky and effective code.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.sololearn.com/Discuss/2314928/how-do-i-insert-a-rectangle-in-the-center-of-a-screen] - This helped me on how to create a rectangle. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp] - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand styling of the border. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
